INSERT INTO skill(id,skill_name,skill_description) VALUES
 (gen_random_uuid (),'Appraise','You can appraise common or well-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise check. Failure means that you estimate the value at 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%,) of its actual value.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Balance','You can walk on a precarious surface. A successful check lets you move at half your speed along the surface for 1 round. A failure by 4 or less means you can’t move for 1 round. A failure by 5 or more means you fall.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Bluff','A Bluff check is opposed by the target’s Sense Motive check. A successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as you wish, at least for a short time (usually 1 round or less) or believes something that you want it to believe.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Climb','With a successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or some other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds) at one-quarter your normal speed. A slope is considered to be any incline at an angle measuring less than 60 degrees; a wall is any incline at an angle measuring 60 degrees or more.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Concentration','You must make a Concentration check whenever you might potentially be distracted (by taking damage, by harsh weather, and so on) while engaged in some action that requires your full attention. Such actions include casting a spell, concentrating on an active spell, directing a spell, using a spell-like ability, or using a skill that would provoke an attack of opportunity. In general, if an action wouldn’t normally provoke an attack of opportunity, you need not make a Concentration check to avoid being distracted.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Craft','Craft is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Craft skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Decipher Script','You can decipher writing in an unfamiliar language or a message written in an incomplete or archaic form. The base DC is 20 for the simplest messages, 25 for standard texts, and 30 or higher for intricate, exotic, or very old writing.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Diplomacy','You can change the attitudes of others (nonplayer characters) with a successful Diplomacy check; see the Influencing NPC Attitudes sidebar, below, for basic DCs. In negotiations, participants roll opposed Diplomacy checks, and the winner gains the advantage. Opposed checks also resolve situations when two advocates or diplomats plead opposite cases in a hearing before a third party.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Disable device','The Disable Device check is made secretly, so that you don’t necessarily know whether you’ve succeeded. The DC depends on how tricky the device is. Disabling (or rigging or jamming) a fairly simple device has a DC of 10; more intricate and complex devices have higher DCs. If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is a trap, you spring it. If you’re attempting some sort of sabotage, you think the device is disabled, but it still works normally.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Disguise','Your Disguise check result determines how good the disguise is, and it is opposed by others’ Spot check results. If you don’t draw any attention to yourself, others do not get to make Spot checks. If you come to the attention of people who are suspicious (such as a guard who is watching commoners walking through a city gate), it can be assumed that such observers are taking 10 on their Spot checks.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Escape artist','Making an Escape Artist check to escape from rope bindings, manacles, or other restraints (except a grappler) requires 1 minute of work.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Forgery','Forgery requires writing materials appropriate to the document being forged, enough light or sufficient visual acuity to see the details of what you’re writing, wax for seals (if appropriate), and some time. To forge a document on which the handwriting is not specific to a person (military orders, a government decree, a business ledger, or the like), you need only to have seen a similar document before, and you gain a +8 bonus on your check. To forge a signature, you need an autograph of that person to copy, and you gain a +4 bonus on the check. To forge a longer document written in the hand of some particular person, a large sample of that person’s handwriting is needed.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Gather information','An evening’s time, a few gold pieces for buying drinks and making friends, and a DC 10 Gather Information check get you a general idea of a city’s major news items, assuming there are no obvious reasons why the information would be withheld. The higher your check result, the better the information. If you want to find out about a specific rumor, or a specific item, or obtain a map, or do something else along those lines, the DC for the check is 15 to 25, or even higher.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Handle animal','This task involves commanding an animal to perform a task or trick that it knows. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC increases by 2.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Heal','You usually use first aid to save a dying character. If a character has negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him or her stable. A stable character regains no hit points but stops losing them.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Hide','You usually use first aid to save a dying character. If a character has negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him or her stable. A stable character regains no hit points but stops losing them.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Intimidate','You can change another’s behavior with a successful check. Your Intimidate check is opposed by the target’s modified level check (1d20 + character level or Hit Dice + target’s Wisdom bonus [if any] + target’s modifiers on saves against fear). If you beat your target’s check result, you may treat the target as friendly, but only for the purpose of actions taken while it remains intimidated.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Jump','The DC and the distance you can cover vary according to the type of jump you are attempting. Your Jump check is modified by your speed. If your speed is 30 feet then no modifier based on speed applies to the check. If your speed is less than 30 feet, you take a -6 penalty for every 10 feet of speed less than 30 feet. If your speed is greater than 30 feet, you gain a +4 bonus for every 10 feet beyond 30 feet. All Jump DCs given here assume that you get a running start, which requires that you move at least 20 feet in a straight line before attempting the jump. If you do not get a running start, the DC for the jump is doubled.Distance moved by jumping is counted against your normal maximum movement in a round.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Knowledge arcana','ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane symbols, cryptic phrases, constructs, dragons, magical beasts')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Knowledge Architecture and engineering','buildings, aqueducts, bridges, fortifications')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Knowledge Dungeoneering','aberrations, caverns, oozes, spelunking')

,(gen_random_uuid (),'Knowledge Religion','gods and goddesses, mythic history, ecclesiastic tradition, holy symbols, undead')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Knowledge The planes','the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, outsiders, elementals, magic related to the planes')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Listen','Your Listen check is either made against a DC that reflects how quiet the noise is that you might hear, or it is opposed by your target’s Move Silently check.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Move silently','Your Move Silently check is opposed by the Listen check of anyone who might hear you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than your full speed, you take a -5 penalty. It’s practically impossible (-20 penalty) to move silently while running or charging.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Open lock','Attempting an Open Lock check without a set of thieves’ tools imposes a -2 circumstance penalty on the check, even if a simple tool is employed. If you use masterwork thieves’ tools, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Perform','You could have several Perform skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Profession','Profession is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Profession skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill. While a Craft skill represents ability in creating or making an item, a Profession skill represents an aptitude in a vocation requiring a broader range of less specific knowledge.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Ride','Typical riding actions don’t require checks. You can saddle, mount, ride, and dismount from a mount without a problem.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Search','You generally must be within 10 feet of the object or surface to be searched.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Sense Motive','A successful check lets you avoid being bluffed. You can also use this skill to determine when “something is up” (that is, something odd is going on) or to assess someone’s trustworthiness.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Sleight of hand','A DC 10 Sleight of Hand check lets you palm a coin-sized, unattended object. Performing a minor feat of legerdemain, such as making a coin disappear, also has a DC of 10 unless an observer is determined to note where the item went. When you use this skill under close observation, your skill check is opposed by the observer’s Spot check. The observer’s success doesn’t prevent you from performing the action, just from doing it unnoticed. You can hide a small object (including a light weapon or an easily concealed ranged weapon, such as a dart, sling, or hand crossbow) on your body. Your Sleight of Hand check is opposed by the Spot check of anyone observing you or the Search check of anyone frisking you.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Spellcraft','Use this skill to identify spells as they are cast or spells already in place.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Spot','The Spot skill is used primarily to detect characters or creatures who are hiding. Typically, your Spot check is opposed by the Hide check of the creature trying not to be seen. Sometimes a creature isn’t intentionally hiding but is still difficult to see, so a successful Spot check is necessary to notice it.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Survival','You can keep yourself and others safe and fed in the wild.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Swim','Make a Swim check once per round while you are in the water. Success means you may swim at up to one-half your speed (as a full-round action) or at one-quarter your speed (as a move action). If you fail by 4 or less, you make no progress through the water. If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Tumble','You can’t use this skill if your speed has been reduced by armor, excess equipment, or loot. You can land softly when you fall or tumble past opponents. You can also tumble to entertain an audience (as though using the Perform skill).')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Use Magic Device','ou can use this skill to read a spell or to activate a magic item. Use Magic Device lets you use a magic item as if you had the spell ability or class features of another class, as if you were a different race, or as if you were of a different alignment. You make a Use Magic Device check each time you activate a device such as a wand. If you are using the check to emulate an alignment or some other quality in an ongoing manner, you need to make the relevant Use Magic Device check once per hour.')
,(gen_random_uuid (),'Use Rope','Most tasks with a rope are relatively simple.');
